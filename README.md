# Version 1 - CryoPHP

After building a successful prototype, I've now decided to go ahead and build a production grade version, this code will 
be much cleaner than that in the prototype branch. All the concepts will still be the same, except annotations will be added
as a plugin as I'm sure many people who cloned the initial repository were more interested in the low code concept in YAML.

To further test this, I will be writing updated documentation on my own personal website, which will use CryoPHP as a framework, 
feel free to use the prototype, its stable if you follow everything correctly, however it doesn't validate any YAML templates properly.
